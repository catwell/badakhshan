# Badakhshan

*NOTE: This is probably not up to date with recent versions of Lapis, and I do not maintain this anymore.*

## Presentation

Badakhshan is a skeleton application using [Lapis](http://leafo.net/lapis/). Logic is written in [Lua](http://www.lua.org/), views and configuration in [MoonScript](http://moonscript.org/). The datastore is [Redis](http://redis.io/).

## Usage

Start with:

    make dev

Make sure you have a local Redis server running on port 6379, then open http://localhost:8080.

For more, see Makefile and config.moon.
